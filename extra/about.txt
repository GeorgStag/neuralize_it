### About

neuralize_it is a simplistic interface 
for running sequential neural networks 
with tensorflow.

We hope to provide a simple, yet 
efficient interface for those who search 
for an instant way to check the potential 
of a neural network on their data, 
avoiding initially the coding grinding 
and even export the model for future use.
